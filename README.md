# rosh - Router Shell

**WARNING** This project is in early development and is missing the major part of its intended function!

This is a interactive diagnostic shell for (software|linux)-based routers. It's inspired by the CLI of network equipment (i.e. Cisco IOS) and implements simular diagnostic commands like the iproute2/bridge/ethtool/tc/wireguard commands.
